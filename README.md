*// Cast: verb. throw (something) forcefully in a specified direction.*

Cast is an agent that lives in your system's
[Status Menu](https://support.apple.com/en-mt/HT201956).
Its purpose is to help you share any type of information quickly and easily with a  keyboard shortcut, a 1-click or drag'n'drop
operation.

Cast will seamlessly figure out the type of information you wish to share and
automatically choose the appropriate service for you. You may customize the
service you wish to use from a selection of available services.

Cast can queue up multiple streams of information and share them all at once 
extending the system's Pasteboard functionality
